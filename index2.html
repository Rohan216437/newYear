          <p>
            You are one of the most genuine person in my life.  
            You’ve supported me so many times and your presence is the most divine thing.  
            We’ve had our conflicts, misunderstandings, and moments where things felt heavy and broke down,  
            but what I love most is that we never gave up on figuring it out and see now still together.  
            
            You stayed, you listened, and you cared, even when it wasn’t easy.  
            And I want to thank you with this year ending.

            With you, it’s never just friendship, it is more liek brotherhood.  
            We’ve done so many things together, shared laughs and many conversations.  
            You’ve been someone I could rely on without overthinking it.  
            
            You stand beside me, and keep things grounded.  
            You are not just a friend, but as someone who genuinely feels like family.
            And thanks to you also.

                Together, we are not just friends but BROs.  
                Now we got different lifes but the same intention that to be there for each other.  
                I genuinely wish the best for both of you, every single day.  
                
                I support you, believe in you, and hope we continue growing individually and together.  
                No matter where life takes us, what we share is something I’ll always value.
                Thanks to both of you for being there always.
            </p>
